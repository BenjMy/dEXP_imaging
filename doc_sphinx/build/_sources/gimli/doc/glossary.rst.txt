    GCC
        The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). Default compiler for most linux
        systems. The Windows port is :term:`MinGW` See: http://gcc.gnu.org/

    GIMLi
        The eponymous software package. See :ref:`sec:GIMLi`

    pyGIMLi
        The eponymous software package. See :ref:`sec:pygimliapi`

    libGIMLi
        The eponymous software package. See :ref:`sec:GIMLi`

    Gmsh
        Gmsh: a three-dimensional finite element mesh generator with built-in
        pre- and post-processing facilities
        :cite:`GeuzaineRemacle2009`
        http://gmsh.info/.
        See: :py:func:`pygimli.meshtools.mesh.readGmsh`

    BERT
        Boundless electrical resistivity tomography http://www.resistivity.net/

    IPython
        An improved :term:`Python` shell that integrates nicely with
        :term:`Matplotlib`. See http://ipython.org/.

    Matplotlib
        Matplotlib :term:`Python` package displays publication quality results.
        It displays both 1D X-Y type plots and 2D contour plots for structured
        and unstructured data. It works on all common platforms and produces
        publication quality hard copies. http://matplotlib.org

    MinGW
        MinGW, a contraction of "Minimalist GNU for Windows", is a minimalist
        development environment for native Microsoft Windows applications. See:
        http://www.mingw.org/

    MSYS
        MSYS, a contraction of "Minimal SYStem", is a Bourne Shell command line
        interpreter system. Offered as an alternative to Microsoft's cmd.exe,
        this provides a general purpose command line environment, which is
        particularly suited to use with MinGW, for porting of many Open Source
        applications to the MS-Windows platform. See: http://www.mingw.org/

    NumPy
        NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It
        is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object and
        various functionalities related to it. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/

    Paraview
        Is an open-source, multi-platform data analysis and visualization
        application. See: http://paraview.org/

    Python
        The programming language that :term:`pyGIMLi` (and your scripts) are
        written in. See: https://www.python.org/

    Pylab
        Meta-package importing several core packages such as :term:`NumPy`,
        :term:`SciPy`, :term:`Matplotlib`, etc. into a single namespace. This is
        usually not recommended due to possible name conflicts but provides a
        quick way to get MATLAB-like functionality.

    PyVista
        3D visualization tool based on VTK: https://www.pyvista.org

    SciPy
        Scientific Computing Tools for Python - Open-source library with many
        numerical routines but the term is often used as a synonym for the
        scientific python community, several conferences, and the *SciPy
        Stack*, i.e. a set of core packages. https://scipy.org/about.html

    Sphinx
        The tools used to generate the :term:`GIMLi` documentation. See:
        http://sphinx-doc.org

    STL
        Unstructured triangulated surface file format native to the "stereolithography"
        CAD software created by 3D Systems. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_%28file_format%29


    SuiteSparse
        SuiteSparse is a single archive that contains packages for solving
        large sparse problems using Sparse Cholesky factorization.

    Triangle
        A Two-Dimensional Quality Mesh Generator and Delaunay Triangulator.
        :cite:`Shewchuk96b`
        http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html
        See: :py:func:`pygimli.meshtools.mesh.readTriangle`

    Tetgen
        A Quality Tetrahedral Mesh Generator and a 3D Delaunay Triangulator.
        :cite:`Si2015`
