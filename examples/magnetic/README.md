Magnetic potential field data
=============================

.. note::

	The magnetic model data was created using geometric objects from fatiando.mesher. The 		forward simulation of the data was done using fatiando.gravmag module.

	Sources properties: 
	    * radius = 1.5e3
	    * inc = 50
	    * dec = -30


* Identify 2 depths of sources produces by 2 distincts magnetic sources using the geometrical method
