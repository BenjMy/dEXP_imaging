Magnetic potential field data
=============================

Sources properties: 
    * radius = 1.5e3
    * inc = 50
    * dec = -30

* Identify 2 depths of sources produces by 2 distincts magnetic sources using the geometrical method
* in prep Identify 2 depths of sources produces by 2 distincts magnetic sources using the dexp ratio method
