Mise-à-la-masse analysis using the dEXP theory
==============================================

The theory of the dEXP theory is applied here for the first time (to our knowledges) for active geoelectrical methods. The theory behind this choice and required adjustements are explained in the documentation section.

We show here a sensitivity analysis (3d) of the dEXP theory apply to Mise-à-la-Masse data. 
In the near future, we'd like to introduce a case study where we used a Mise-à-la-Masse survey to identify a leakage in a landfill.
