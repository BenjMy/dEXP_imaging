Mise-à-la-masse analysis using the dEXP theory
==============================================

The theory of the dEXP theory is applied here for the first time (to our knowledges) for active geoelectrical methods. The theory behind this choice and required adjustements are explained in the documentation section.

We show here: 

* The [preprocessing](examples/malm/clearB.py) of MALM for dEXP;
* a sensitivity analysis to **anomaly depth** (3d) of the dEXP theory apply to Mise-à-la-Masse data;
* effect of **noise level**;
* **in prep**: a case study where we used a Mise-à-la-Masse survey to identify a leakage in a landfill;
* **in prep**: effect of borehole data and downward continuation.
